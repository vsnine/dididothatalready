# Hello World

I decided to learn more about my journey in learning various technologies, this time with Cloudflare Pages and participate in one of the community challenges to setup a blog.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Cloudflare Pages is now Generally Available. <a href="https://t.co/bvIsZGGQRT">https://t.co/bvIsZGGQRT</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DeveloperWeek?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#DeveloperWeek</a>ðŸ’»</p>&mdash; Cloudflare (@Cloudflare) <a href="https://twitter.com/Cloudflare/status/1381593197311315973?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 12, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I use Cloudflare in my day job as well as for personal projects. Learning how the product works can seem overwhelming sometimes as they have many features which can work for most web apps. So far my biggest focus has been on the core parts of WAF, DNS, and optimization.

It seems like it has been a million years since I last tried to write a blog, we'll see how this goes :)
